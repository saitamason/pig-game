## ℹ️ Instructions
This is a game for 2 players. The first player starts by rolling the dice. If the number on the dice is greater than 1, it is added to the current score. The player then has two options: 1) roll again, or 2) hold to the points and let the second player make its turn. Rolling again may earn additional points but it's also risky because if the number on the dice is 1, then you lose all additional points. The first one who gets 100 points, wins!
